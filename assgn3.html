<p>Go ahead just leave, can't hold you, you're free
You take all these <script>document.write("things");</script>, if they mean so much to you
I gave you your dreams, 'cause you meant the world
So did I deserve to be left here hurt
</p>
You think I don't know you're out of control
I ended up finding all of this from my boys
Girl, you're stone cold, you say it ain't so,
You already know <script>document.write("I");</script>'m not attached to material
I'd give it all up but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, I'm takin' back my love
I've given you too much but I'm takin' back my love
I'm takin' back my love, my love, my love, my love
My love
Yeah</p>
<p>
What did I do but give love to you
I'm just <script>document.write("confused");</script> as I stand here and look at you
From head to feet, all that's not me
Go 'head, keep the keys, that's not what I need from you
You</p>
